# ~~[Position Tracker] Oculus Tracking~~

Functioning principle:

- If an oculus indicator appears on the minimap, that oculus will be unmarked on the map client
- If an oculus indicator does not appear at the corresponding location on the minimap, that oculus will be marked as found

<p>Important Note: <span style="color: red">This feature is not 100% accurate. False positives can occur when oculi don't appear on the minimap because they are vertically distant, either in the air or under ground.</span></p>
